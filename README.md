# Persona AI

Learn from AI versions of your favorite mentors — chat with AI personas modeled
on the **public teaching styles** of **Hitesh Choudhary** and **Piyush Garg**.

Built with Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Clerk Authentication,
LangChain, and Google Gemini (or OpenAI).

> ⚠️ **Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or an official product of Hitesh Choudhary
> or Piyush Garg.** This is a fan-made educational project. Persona prompts are
> built only from publicly available content (official websites, YouTube,
> blogs, GitHub, LinkedIn, X/Twitter) — see `lib/personas.ts` and
> `lib/prompts.ts`, and the "Reference sources" links in the app's Settings page.

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React
- **Auth:** Clerk (Google / GitHub / Email)
- **AI:** [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) via the official `openai` SDK — a single OpenAI-compatible client routes requests to any model OpenRouter hosts (Gemini, GPT, Claude, Llama, Qwen, ...)
- **Markdown/Code:** `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + `react-syntax-highlighter`
- **Storage:** Browser `localStorage` only — no database

## 4. How the persona chat works

1. `lib/prompts.ts` defines a detailed system prompt per persona (teaching
   style, tone, catchphrases, restrictions) — **unchanged** by the OpenRouter
   migration.
2. Only the **last ~12 messages** (`MEMORY_WINDOW` in `lib/config.ts`) are
   sent verbatim to the model; anything older is condensed into a short
   summary block appended to the system prompt as "Retrieved Context"
   (`buildMemory` in `lib/prompts.ts`).
3. `lib/openrouter.ts` creates a single, shared `openai` SDK client
   configured with `baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"` and
   `apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. **Every** AI call in the app
   goes through this one client — there is no direct Gemini or OpenAI SDK
   usage anywhere.
4. `lib/config.ts` exports `AI_MODEL`, the single source of truth for which
   model OpenRouter should route to (e.g. `google/gemini-2.5-flash`,
   `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`, `anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet`, ...). Changing
   providers/models means editing **only this one line** — no other file
   needs to change.
5. `lib/ai.ts` builds the OpenAI-style `messages` array (`system` + trimmed
   history) and calls `openrouter.chat.completions.create({ model: AI_MODEL,
   stream: true, ... })`, yielding plain text chunks as they arrive.
6. `app/api/chat/route.ts` is a Clerk-protected streaming endpoint. It pipes
   those chunks back to the client as a raw `ReadableStream` — never
   exposing `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to the browser. If OpenRouter isn't
   configured at all, it fails fast with a normal JSON 500 response; if a
   failure happens *after* streaming has already started (rate limit,
   dropped connection, empty completion, etc.), the friendly error message is
   smuggled through the stream using a marker (`lib/stream-protocol.ts`) so
   the frontend can show a toast instead of rendering it as chat content.
7. `hooks/useChat.ts` reads the stream chunk-by-chunk, updates the
   in-progress assistant message for a ChatGPT-style token effect, detects
   the error marker if present (toast + graceful fallback text), and powers
   **Stop Generation** via `AbortController`.
8. Every conversation is persisted to `localStorage` (`lib/storage.ts`) keyed
   by persona, and restored automatically on reload.

Switching personas (via the pill switcher) always starts a **brand-new
conversation** — it does not carry over context, per the spec.

### Changing the model

Edit `lib/config.ts` only:

```ts
export const AI_MODEL = "google/gemini-2.5-flash";

// export const AI_MODEL = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini";
// export const AI_MODEL = "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet";
// export const AI_MODEL = "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct";
// export const AI_MODEL = "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b";
```

Any model id listed on [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)
works — no other file requires modification.

### Error handling

`lib/ai.ts` normalizes every failure mode into a friendly `AIRequestError`
message, surfaced to the user as a Sonner toast:

| Failure | User sees |
|---|---|
| Missing/invalid `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | "Invalid or missing OpenRouter API key..." |
| HTTP 429 from OpenRouter | "OpenRouter rate limit reached. Please wait a moment..." |
| HTTP 5xx from OpenRouter | "OpenRouter is temporarily unavailable..." |
| Network error / DNS failure | "Network error while reaching OpenRouter..." |
| Timeout / aborted request | "The request timed out..." |
| Empty completion (no tokens returned) | "The model returned an empty response..." |

- Skeleton/shimmer loading states, error boundary with retry
- `manifest.json` + favicon for basic PWA installability

## 6. Roadmap / not yet wired up

These were listed as "bonus/stretch" items in the spec and are good next
iterations, intentionally left out to keep this build focused and correct:

- **Persona Comparison Mode** (split-screen, both personas answer the same question)
- **AI-generated follow-up questions** after each response
- **In-chat search** across the current conversation
- A dedicated **Pinned Messages** view (pin toggle exists on each message, but there's no separate pinned list yet)
- **Manual conversation rename** (titles currently auto-generate from the first message)
- **PDF export** (Markdown/TXT export is implemented)
- Full offline PWA support (service worker + caching — manifest only today)

## 7. Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import it into Vercel.
3. Add the environment variables from `.env.example` in Project Settings → Environment Variables.
4. Deploy. Update Clerk's allowed redirect URLs to your production domain.
